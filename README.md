# Intro

### Hi everyone!

Here we will put all our material for the "Intro" part of the course.
The structure will follow the style described in my re-Intro presentation, which you can find in the folder for the date 24.08.20.

_Note: The structure will change starting with the Programming Basics module, since we will start following the DCI course structure then_
