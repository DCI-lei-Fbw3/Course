# Planning in pairs

In pairs (one group will be of three), please design a system (write code or draw diagrams or just pen an essay) that will take a user's details, sign them up, and then on login will create a session. 
The user sessions can be stateless (see Taimur's code from 29.03.21) or statefull.

At 14:45, your pair/group will get 15 mins to present your system. 10 mins for presentation, 5 for questions. 


## The system should:

- Have a landing
- Should have a login, with a session
- Should have a signup
- Should have at least one protected page


## Some key pointers
The system should also:

- Have a basic data structure/schema for the user
- Have the relevant front-end to generate the data
- Have a backend to communicate with
- Have a database

***NOTE: Please make sure you are clearly able to present how you will make this system, not so much what***
