# Pair Programming on Github

Please pair up and create a new github repository as a dummy project (one of you). 
Give your project a name, and add your colleague to your project. 
Next, follow the steps as:

1. Create a project board for the repository, with a relevant structure for your columns.
2. Create a some initial issues on the repository (each partner should creae at least 5 issues). Then discuss how many issues you will tackle in the next SPRINT (sprints can be a certain length of time, e.g. 1 week or 2 weeks or so). 
3. Assign the issues to the relevant partner. 
4. Update your project board accordingly.
5. Create branches for at least 2 issues per partner, make some changes in those branches, and create Pull-Requests. (REMEMBER: after creating a pull request, you will have to commit the change, AND THEN merge those changes.)
6. Once changes are merged to the Master branch, close the relvant issues.
