//------- Create a simple online banking application that comprises the following features:


1- There is an authentication function that takes [IBAN & pincode] and returns a "token number" (it can be a random number too).

    For instance:  curl -d "IBAN=DE000000000&picode=1234" -X POST  http://localhost:7000/authentication

2- Create a function that takes the generated token and a given amount, and allows you to transfer some money to your bank account (increase your current balance)

    For instance:  curl -d "token={generatedToken}&amount=1000" -X POST  http://localhost:7000/transfer


3- Create a function that takes the generate token and a given amount   to withdraw this amount from your current balance:

   For instance:  curl -d "token={generatedToken}&amount=1000" -X POST  http://localhost:7000/withdraw


4- Create a function that takes the generate token and presents your current balance (by taking the token alone):

      For instance:  curl -d "token={generatedToken}" -X POST  http://localhost:7000/balance
