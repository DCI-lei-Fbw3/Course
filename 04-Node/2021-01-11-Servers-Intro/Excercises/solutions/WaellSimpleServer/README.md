## Instructions for students:

### Serve the Keyboard
Last week you did an excercise where you printed out a keyboard from a txt-file. This is what we want our server to return. So please combine both solutions in such a way that when you access "http://localhost:3000/keyboard" you get the actual keyboard.

**Bonuses**

- You might want to add other paths to the server as well. How would you do that? Implement at least the /blog and /keyboard path.

- When trying to access a path you did not implement, you might notice that the server will not respond. Wouldn't it be nice to recieve the correct HTTP Statuscode for this situation instead?


### Rules

-   This is an individual assignment.
-   Use **Git properly**
