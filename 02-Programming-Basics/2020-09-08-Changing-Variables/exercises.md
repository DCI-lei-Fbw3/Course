# Variables Excercise

You will work in teams to solve as many of the following excercises as you can in 90 mins. 
Team work is key here, everyone has to respoect their fellow teammates and everyone has to contribute!


## The Fortune Teller

_Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?_

* Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
* Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

## The Age Calculator

_Want to find out how old you'll be? Calculate it!_

* Store your birth year in a variable.
* Store a future year in a variable.
* Calculate your 2 possible ages for that year based on the stored values.
* For example, if you were born in 1988, then in 2026 you'll be either 37 or 38, depending on what month it is in 2026.
* Output them to the screen like so: "I will be either NN or NN in YYYY", substituting the values.


## The Lifetime Supply Calculator

_Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!_

* Store your current age into a variable.
* Store a maximum age into a variable.
* Store an estimated amount per day (as a number).
* Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life.
* Output the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X".

## The Geometrizer 

_Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here : http://math2.org/math/geometry/circles.html_

* Store a radius into a variable.
* Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
* Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

## The Temperature Converter

_It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here: https://www.mathsisfun.com/temperature-conversion.html_

* Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
* Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN°C is NN°F".
* Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
* Convert it to celsius and output "NN°F is NN°C."
