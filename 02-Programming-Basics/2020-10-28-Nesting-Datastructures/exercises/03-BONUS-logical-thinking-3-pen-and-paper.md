# Logical Thinking III

Write pseudo-code for the following exercises on pen and paper.

#### 1. Lowest to Highest

Given an array of numbers from 1-9:

```javascript
[4, 2, 5, 3, 9, 7, 1, 8, 2, 6];
```

Sort the array from lowest value to highest.

#### 2. Alphabetical Order

Given an array of names:

```javascript
["Fran", "Leon", "Ale", "Jenna", "Bleda", "Hadi"];
```

Sort the array based on alphabetical order from `a â†’ z`.

**Bonuses**

1. Once you've wrote down your pen and paper solutions, create functions to solve the problems above with javascript.

2. Create a function that takes an array as a parameter. Order the array based off of the elements' length. Assume the elements are strings.
