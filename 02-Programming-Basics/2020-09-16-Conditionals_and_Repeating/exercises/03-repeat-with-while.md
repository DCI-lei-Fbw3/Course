/*# Repeat

## 1. Run Along
Create a `while` loop that runs as long as the variable `i` is less than 15. Print `i`.

## 2. Add it up
Create a function which sums up numbers from 1-20 using a `while` loop.

## 3. Do this while i...
Use a `do`, `while` loop to print `The number is [i]` while i is less than 20.*/
