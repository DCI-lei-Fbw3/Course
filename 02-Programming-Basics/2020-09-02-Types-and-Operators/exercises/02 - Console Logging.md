# CONSOLE.LOG EXERCISES: Getting Started 

These exercises are aimed at making you familiar with using node to run your scripts & the console.log method. For each exercise, run your script in node to check if your console.log(s) are working. Remember to use camelCase where needed.

Make your own JavaScript file and work from there. Open up your terminal in VS Code.  

1. Console log a line of text eg. "this is an exercise in console logging" (do not forget quotation marks). 

2. Declare a variable and give your variable the following value: "This is the value.". Console log your **variable**. 

3. Declare a variable called firstName and assign your first name to that variable. Do the same with your last name. Console log both variables. NOTE: When console logging two variables, separate the variables with a comma (,) in the console log e.g. console.log(variable1, variable2);

4. Make a profile of someone's information. Store all the information in variables eg. name, city, job etc. (five variables total) Console log the variables. 

5. Print a sentence using the profile variables above, adding text where necessary for sentence flow, i.e., "John Smith is a 43 year old teacher who lives in Berlin". **you can combine variables with text in the console by using the plus symbol (+) e.g. console.log("this is a " + variable);**
