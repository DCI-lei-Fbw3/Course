# Variables Excercise

You will work individually to solve as many of the following excercises as you can in 90 mins. 

## The Fortune Teller

_Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?_

* Write a function named tellFortune that:
        ** takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
        ** outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
* Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.

## The Puppy Age Calculator

_You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!_

* Write a function named calculateDogAge that:
        1) takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
        2) calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
        3) outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"
* Call the function three times with different sets of values.
* Bonus: Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years.

## The Lifetime Supply Calculator

_Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!_

* Write a function named calculateSupply that:
        1) takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
        2) calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
        3) outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
* Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
* Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.

## The Geometrizer 

_Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here : http://math2.org/math/geometry/circles.html_

* Create a function called calcCircumfrence:

    1) Pass the radius to the function.
    2) Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".

* Create a function called calcArea:

    1) Pass the radius to the function.
    2) Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

## The Temperature Converter

_It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here: https://www.mathsisfun.com/temperature-conversion.html_

* Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:

        1) Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
        2)Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".

* Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:

        1) Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
        2)Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
