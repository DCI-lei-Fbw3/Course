# On the block

1. Updater

Depending on the value of a variable (determiner), assign a value to x.
If determiner is less than 0, x's value should be "Less than 0"
If determiner is greater or equal 0, x's value should "Greater or equal to 0".

2. New Variables

* Depending on the value of the determiner, assign a value to another variable (updater) and create another variable.

a. If determiner is greater of equal to 0, updater's value should be "Greater or equal to 0" and create another variable called message, assign a value of "Positive Integer" and print message.

b. If determiner is less than 0, updater's value should be "Less than 0".

* Question: What would happen if we tried to print "message" outside of the if statement? Comment your answer in the js file.
