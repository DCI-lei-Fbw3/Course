/*# Switch Cases: Taimur's opinion on some fruits

The idea is to do the same task using both if/else statements and switch/cases.

In this exercise, create a program that:
    * Creates a variable that takes its value from a prompt() function
    * The user is able to enter four values only:
        ** apples
        ** bananas
        ** oranges
        ** mangoes

For each corresponding fruit type, log the following  in the console:

* apples: "Apples are ok."
* bananas: "Bananas are good before and after a football match."
* oranges: "I can eat oranges all day!"
* mangoes: "Did someone say mangoes? Where?"*/
