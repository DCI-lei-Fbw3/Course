# Convert Number to Corresponding Month Name

Create a function that takes a number (from 1 to 12) and returns its corresponding month name as a string. For example, if you're given 3 as input, your function should return "March", because March is the 3rd month.

Number | Month Name
-------|-----------
1  | January
2  | February
3  | March
4  | April
5  | May
6  | June
7  | July
8  | August
9  | September
10 | October
11 | November
12 | December

## Examples

```
monthName(3) ➞ "March"

monthName(12) ➞ "December"

monthName(6) ➞ "June"
```

## Notes

    You can expect only integers ranging from 1 to 12 as test input.
