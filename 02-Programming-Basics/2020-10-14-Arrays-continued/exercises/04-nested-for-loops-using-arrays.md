# Programming Basics: Nested Loops (Using Arrays)

**Use NESTED LOOPS in each instance**

1. Write a program to construct the following pattern:

```
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
```

2. Write a program which prints the elements of the following array:

```
let arr = [[1, 2, 1, 24], [8, 11, 9, 4], [7, 0, 7, 27], [7, 4, 28, 14], [3, 10, 26, 7]];
```

And creates the following output:

```
row 0
 1
 2
 1
 24
row 1
```

3. Write a program that will output the following using loops:

```
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4
0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4
```
