a)  From the given task we can see that robot has to go through the specific route and at every stop it makes it should check whether this customer has a parcel to ship or receive parcel    instead. Once the check is done, it has to move forward to the next point, but we have to build the function that way that it loops through given graph and find the shortest and most optimal route, which means avoiding customers that it's already visited, and also from closest to futher destination. 
At  first we see that we've been given an object with its values, where we see strings as connection "trips" made from one point to another. Using this array of strings we are creating a function that build graph and we store it in const roadGraph. 
As for this step, we're making automation that checks which point robot has to go, and is there any delivery or shipment waiting. As for me I thought would be good to implement for keys of obejcts their values, like  const road.Alicehouse.
