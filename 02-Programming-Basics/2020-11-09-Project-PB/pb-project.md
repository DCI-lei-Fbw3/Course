# A Robot - Programming Basics Project 
  
Congratulations! You have made it through the Programming Basics module. In order to give you a chance to consolidate your new knowledge in JavaScript, you will be working on a pair-programming* project. The tasks are simple, and its not so much about coming up with new code, but rather to understand and use JavaScript in a given context. 

 *Pair-programming: you will work on the project in pairs (with one group of three). The pairing will be announced in class.
  
 ## Project details

 - The project is called "A Robot", and it is taken from Chapter 7 of Eloquent Javascript.
 - You have the PDF of the chapter and the associated code attached to this folder.
 - If you do not want to work on setting up the program in your own environment, you can find a code-sandbox here:https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/#7
 However, as always, please do not look at he solutions otherwise whats the point to doing an exercise?
 - _Submission Deadline_: **12.11.20** by 16:00 (can be extended for those who need it, please reach out)
 
 ## Deliverables

 1. Read entire project chapter.
 2. Make the program work. 
 3. Answer all three Exercises at the end of the chapter and sumit answers as JS file.
 4. Write a (max) two page report, explaining:
 
    a. Your understanding of the flow of the program (where does it start and where does it end?)
    
    b. Does the program achieve its goals? How?
    
    c. Make a few suggestions on how you can improve the program. Implementations of your suggestions would work better. 
    
    d. Please elaborate what concepts of Javscript did you see being implemented in the program (functional programming, objects and array methods etc.)
