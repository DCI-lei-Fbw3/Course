1. ## Sum of Squares

A constructor function SquareSum(num1,num2,num3) is provided which takes three numbers as properties. You have to initialize them. The constructor function also contains a method squaresum(). Implement it in a way such that it computes the square of the three numbers and returns their sum.

**Sample Input**
2, 3, 4 â€‹

**Sample Output**
29
*/

function SquareSum(_num1,_num2,_num3){
    this.num1 = _num1;
    this.num2 = _num2;
    this.num3 = _num3;  
    this.squaresum = function(){
        return ( this.num1*this.num1 + this.num2*this.num2 + this.num3*this.num3 )  
    }
}

let object = new SquareSum(2,3,4) 

console.log(object.squaresum())

/* 
2. ## Calculator

A constructor function called `Calculator` is given with fields: `num1` and `num2`. 
You have to add the following methods to the constructor function:

`add()`: a method which returns the sum after the addition of `num1` and `num2`.

`subtract()`: a method which returns the subtraction of `num1` from `num2`

`multiply()`: a method which returns the multiplication of `num1` and `num2`.

`divide()`: a method which returns the division of `num2` by `num1`.

**Sample Input**

```javascript
var obj = new Calculator(5,10)
obj.add()
obj.subtract()
obj.multiply()
obj.divide()
```

**Sample Output**

```
15
5
50
2
```

```javascript
*/


function Calculator(_num1,_num2) {

  this.num1 = _num1; //initialize properties
  this.num2 = _num2; // Addition Method
  this.add = function(){
    return this.num1 + this.num2
    }
  this.subtract = function(){
      return this.num2 - this.num1; // Subtraction Method
    }
  this.multiply = function(){
      return this.num1 * this.num2; // Multiplication Method
    }
  this.divide = function(){
      return this.num2 / this.num1; // Divison Method
    }
    
}


var obj = new Calculator(5,10)
console.log(obj.add())
console.log(obj.subtract())
console.log(obj.multiply())
console.log(obj.divide())

 3. ## Calculate the Students' Total Marks

A constructor function called Student is given with the following parameters:

- `marks1`
- `marks2`

```
Important Note: Both marks1 and marks2 should be assigned to protected variables, _marks1 and _marks2, during initialization. More on private Variables:https://philipwalton.com/articles/implementing-private-and-protected-members-in-javascript/

```
Next, you have to define the following methods such that they can be shared by all object instances created:

`getMarks(markNumber)`: a method which should return `_marks1` if `markNumber` equals 1 and `_marks2` if markNumber equals 2.

`calcTotal()`: the method should return the sum of `_marks1` and `_marks2`.

**Sample Input**

```javascript
var student = new Student(60,70)
```

**Sample Output**

```
getMarks(1)  => 60
getMarks(2)  => 70
calcTotal() => 130
```

```javascript
function Student(marks1,marks2) {

  //Define and initialize both private properties here

  //Define the getMarks function on Student prototype here

  //Define the calcTotal function on Student prototype here
}
```
