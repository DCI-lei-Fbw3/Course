# Logic Question of the week

How many different ways can you paint a cube with three different colors of paint?

Simple answer: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 (3^6) = 729

However, a cube has indistuinguishable sides. And the number is actually much less. --> the 729 figure counts as different all six cases where one face is painted one color and ther others are different.

Solution:
- There are three ways of painting a cube with exactly 1 color, chosen from three
- There are twenty-four ways of paintiing a cube with exactly 2 out 3 colors
- There are thirty ways of painting a cube with exactly three colors

**Total** = 57
