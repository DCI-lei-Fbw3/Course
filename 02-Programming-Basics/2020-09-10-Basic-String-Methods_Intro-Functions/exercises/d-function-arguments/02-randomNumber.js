/*

    - create a function "randomInteger"
    - that function takes two arguments (min, max)
      only positive integers allowed, but no test is required, 
      assume "min" and "max" are always positive integers including 0
      also assume that "max" is bigger than "min", - also not test for this
    - it should return an integer between and including "min" and "max"

    - use the function "randomInteger" to: 
      - output some random numbers with min=0 and max=1
      - output some random numbers with min=0 and max=100
      - output some random numbers with min=1 and max=6
