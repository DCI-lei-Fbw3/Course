/*

    - create a two functions "randomFloat" and "randomInteger"
    - they take two arguments (min, max)
      only positive integers allowed, but no test is required, 
      assume "min" and "max" are always positive integers including 0
      also assume that "max" is bigger than "min"
    - it should return an integer between and including "min" and "max"

    - output some random numbers with min=0 and max=1
    - output some random numbers with min=0 and max=100
    - output some random numbers with min=1 and max=6
