# Declaring Functions

#### 1. Multiply - Function Declaration
* Create a function that multiples a number by another number.
function toMultiply (a, b) {
    return (a*b);
}

console.log(toMultiply)
#### 2. Multiply - Function Declarations as Values
* Rework the syntax of the above function so that the function declaration is stored as a value.

#### 3. Multiply - Arrow Function
* Rework the syntax of the function declaration so that is uses the arrow function shorthand.

#### 4. Declarations
* Create functions (using all three declarations) to check the remainder of division given two numbers.
