/*

Generate 10 random Numbers between [0, 1[  - that is 0 <= NUMBER < 1

define a const THRESHOLD and assign a value between the former interval

Loop over the generated numbers and log an alarm with the value and THRESHOLD, like:
"Attention: current value (VALUE) exceeds the threshold (THRESHOLD) by DIFFERENCE."

Bonus:
For each 0.1 of difference add an "*" at the start of the logged line, e. g. 
"*** Attention: current value (0.67859) exceeds the threshold (0.3) by 0.37859."

To determine the number of "*", the difference may be rounded down.
