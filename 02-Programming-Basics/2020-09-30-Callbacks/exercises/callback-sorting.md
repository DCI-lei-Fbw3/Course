# Callbacks

let fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango", "Strawberry"];
let numbers = [100, 22, 42, 1, -34];
let persons = ["Albert Einstein", "Lise Meitner", "Gene Simmons", "Patrick Swayze", "Alice Cooper", "Ronny James Dio", "Bruce Dickinson", "Marcus Miller", "Nathan East", "Al di Meola", "Gloria Estefan", "Naima Husseini", "Alin Coen", "Tina Dico"];

## 1. Sort the numbers in reverse numerical order (from the biggest to the smallest number)

## 2. Sort the persons by their last name

## 3. String sorting

### a) What happens to the sorting order of the fruits-array if you add "apple" or "raspberry"

### b) Why is that?

### c) Create and use a compare-callback-function that treats characters as beeing the same if their only difference is their capitalization (lowercase/uppercase; "a" == "A").

Hint 1: Use a search engine to get a first idea, on how to sort strings with a custom function.

Hint 2: Useful string-functions may be:

```
    toLowerCase()
    toUpperCase()
    charCodeAt()
```
