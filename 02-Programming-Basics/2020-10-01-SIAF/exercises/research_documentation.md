# Research Documentation

There are two to three main modes of how to read a document:

-   getting a broad overview, by scanning the structure and main parts

    -   scan contents, headlines, subsection

-   searching for a specific information

    -   in case of an electronic document you can use the inbuilt search mechanism, else use the contents section, register/keyword list...

-   reading it thoroughly from top to bottom

    -   learning, taking notes, try out (experiment)
