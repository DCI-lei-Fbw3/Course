# Strings and Numbers

#### 1. Concatenation. 
* Create two variables. One variable should contain a string value and the other should contain a number. Concatenate the string and the number.
```javascript
let introSentence = "hello, my name is Fran and I am";
let age = 25;
```

**Expected Output**: 
```javascript
"hello, my name is Fran and I am 25"
```
* In this case, what is the `+` operator doing? Comment your answer in the js file.

#### 2. Converting 
* Create a variable with the value of "1005". Convert it to a number.
* Create a variable with the value of "10.05". Convert it to a number.
