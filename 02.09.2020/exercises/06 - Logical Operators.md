# Programming Basics: Logical Operators

These exercises are aimed at making you familiar with logical operators. **Print all your checks to the console. Every capitalized word stands for the logical operator that you must use in each task. Make sure that you are using the *correct* logical operator.**

0. Declare two variables: "dogIsBetter" with the value of true, and "catIsBetter" with the value of false.

1. Check the result of:

- a) dogIsBetter AND catIsBetter.

- b) dogIsBetter OR catIsBetter.

- c) NOT (dogIsBetter AND catIsBetter).

2. Declare three more variables "atoms", "sandGrains", "starsInSky". Give these variables number values.

3. Check the result of whether:

- a) atoms is greater than starsInSky AND atoms is greater than sandGrains.

- b) atoms is NOT equal to sandGrains.

- c) starsInSky is less than sandGrains OR starsInSky is greater than atoms.

- d) atoms is equal to starsInSky OR atoms is NOT equal to sandGrains.

- e) atoms is greater than or equal to 10 AND sandGrains is less than or equal to 10.

- f) atoms multiplied by starsInSky is less than 100 OR whether atoms multiplied by sandGrains is greater than 100.

4. BONUS: Explain in words the logic of each result in a comment after the result.
