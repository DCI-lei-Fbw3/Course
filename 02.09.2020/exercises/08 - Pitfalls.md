# Pitfalls 

#### 1. NaN
**Question: Comment your answer in your js file**: What does NaN stand for? 
* Check if `"hello"` is NaN. 
* Check if `3` is NaN.
* What is the type of NaN?

#### 2. Rounding 
```javascript
console.log(0.1 * 0.2);
```
The above in JavaScript will print: `0.020000000000000004`. 
Use a method to make sure that only `0.02` is printed.

#### 3. Infinity
* Divide Infinity by `0`. 
* Divide Infinity by Infinity. 
* Divide `1` by `0`.
