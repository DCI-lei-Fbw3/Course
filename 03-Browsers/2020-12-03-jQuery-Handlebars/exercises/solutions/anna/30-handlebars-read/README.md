# Handlebars: the right object

> Make sure to include handlebars: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/handlebars.js/4.7.3/handlebars.js` into your `index.html`.

Create your custom JavaScript file and include it in the HTML.

Next, take a look at the template defined in the `index.html`, to that template an object is passed, note how that object's structure fits to the attributes used in the template.

Last, the generated HTML is displayed in the html in the section with id `output`.

There are styles provided.
