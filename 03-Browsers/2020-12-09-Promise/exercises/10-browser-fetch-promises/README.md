# Promise me a modal

## Setup

```
	# may take a couple of minutes, - and even if it seems to hang => wait for it
	$> npm install

	# start the development web-server:
	$> npm start
	# the output will show how to reach the server,
	# look for something like "http://localhost:8080"

```

**Instructions**:
Create a promise that, once resolved, displays a modal to the user after the user spends 60seconds on the page. Use the `index.html` and `main.scss` as your starting files.

**Notes**:

-   The user should be able to close the modal.
