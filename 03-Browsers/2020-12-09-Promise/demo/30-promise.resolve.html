    <h1>Promise.resolve()</h1>

    MDN: <blockquote>
        "The Promise.resolve() method returns a Promise object that is resolved with a given value. If the value is a promise, that promise is returned; if the value is a thenable (i.e. has a "then" method), the returned promise will "follow" that thenable, adopting its eventual state; otherwise the returned promise will be fulfilled with the value. This function flattens nested layers of promise-like objects (e.g. a promise that resolves to a promise that resolves to something) into a single layer."

    <h2>Demonstration</h2>

    <div id="target"></div>

</body>
<script>

    // get the target element
    let element = document.getElementById("target");

    element.append(" 0 ");

    // lets resolve some promises
    // resolve() is a static method => can be called on the class (without an object)
    let p1 = Promise.resolve(" 1 "); // resolve returns a Promise.
    // and then append that promise's value to it
    p1.then(function(value) { // "then" is an object method, so it can only be called on an "Promise" object
        element.append(value);
    });

    let p2 = Promise.resolve(" 2 ");
    p2.then(function(value) {
        element.append(value);
    });

    // the primises
    let p3 = Promise.resolve(" 3 ");
    let p4 = Promise.resolve(p3);
    let p5 = Promise.resolve(p4);
    p5.then(
        (p5) => element.append(p5)
    );
