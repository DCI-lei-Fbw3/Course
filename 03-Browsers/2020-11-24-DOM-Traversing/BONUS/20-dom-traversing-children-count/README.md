# Counting children

This is a template from an online site.
Feel free to explore the files it contains, but this is absolutely not required to be able to complete this exercise.
What you need is to create your own JavaScript file and make sure it is included in the `index.html` file.

You can use Visual Code live server to run the project.

## 1.
* Get the children of the element with id `wrapper` and print them to the console as a list.

* Iterate over them and print their children to the console, as well as how many they are.

Note: We do not want to do this operation recursively, we just do it for the children of wrapper and its children.

Note: There are 2 ways to print the number of children - give them both a try.

## 2.

* Next, we need to find which from the children of the element with id `wrapper` has the highest number of classes.

    For example, if one element has 2 classes and another has 3 classes - the one with 3 classes has the highest number of classes.

    Let's write a function that returns an object that contains the element with the most classes and the total number of classes.
