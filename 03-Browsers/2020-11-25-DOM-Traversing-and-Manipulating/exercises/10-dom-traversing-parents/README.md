# Parents list

Let's print all the elements that are parents of the element `cite` to the console.

We want to print them as a string in the following format:

```
html > body > main > section > blockquote > footer > cite
```

We want the string to start from the most outer parent to the element cite we started from.

Extra: Can you also add to the same string the classes each parent has, for example: `section.page > blockquote`.
