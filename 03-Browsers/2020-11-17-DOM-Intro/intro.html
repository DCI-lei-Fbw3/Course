<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--The Script Tag-->
<!--In order to use JS in your HTML code, you can use the script tag. The script tag runs JS synchronously as your HTML renders -->

    <head>
        <title>test</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>Testing Window Object</h1>
    <button onclick = "createWindow()"> Open a window 
    </button>
   <!--  <script >
    function test () { 
    window.prompt("Enter some text");
    };
        test();
    </script> -->
 <!--    <script>  
    
    function test () { 
        console.log("This is a test message")
    };
            
    </script>  The browser will move from rendering to interpreting javasript -->
   
    <h1>End</h1>

    <!--The Window Object -->

    <!-- Window is a global interface, meaning it is globally available within our programs in the browser.
    - The window object is used to control the browser window lifecycle.
    - There is a global variable called "window", which rrepresents the current browser window in which the code is runnning.
    - This variable can directly be accessed by using "window" literal.
    - In case of a multi-tab browser, the window object represents a single tab.
    - Whenever you open a new window or tab, a window object representing that window/tab is automatically created.
    - The properties of a window object are used to retrieve information about the window that is currentÃ¶y open, 
    whereas its methods are used to perform specific tasks like opening, maximizing, minimizing the window etc.
    -->


        <script >
        function createWindow () { 
       let url = "https://google.com";
       let win = window.open(url, "Google", "width =600", "height=800");
       let h = window.outerHeight;
       let w = window.outerWidth;
       
       window.alert("Height and width of the window are " + h + "and" + w);
        };
        </script>
</body>

 <!-- Native vs Host Objects -->

    <!-- Notes
    - Native objects are native to the programming language (JS), for example arrays, functions etc.
    - Host objects are objects avilable only in certain environments, for example window object in browser or Nodelists object in Node



        Window is a Host Object, meaning its only avaible within the browser environment
        Document is a Host Object, meaning its only avaible within the browser environment
    -->

  <!-- The Document Object -->  

  <!-- Notes
    - The Document object represents any web page loaded in the browser window, and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM Tree.
    - The DOM tree includes elements, such as <table> or <body>. 
    - The DOM provides functionality globally to the document, like how to obtains the pages'URL and create new elements in the document.
    - There is a contructor function for creating new documents dynamically, which is:
   -->

<script>
    new Document(); // this is the sytanx for dynamically creating new Documents in the browser
    let neuDoc = new Document(); //the variable neuDoc is a document in the browser and you can use it as such

    neuDoc.selectbyID("div2");


//The 2 window objects methods you will need for your exercise, are window.prompt() and window.alert()
</script>
