//Welcome Fbw3!
// Topic: React - Authentication 
//Reference: 

// Intro

    /* 
    - I have created a backend for your rect app to communicate with
    - Github repo: https://github.com/thisistaimur/mongo-express-auth
    - This backend also in production on Heroku: https://mongo-express-auth.herokuapp.com
    - API Docs:
        - /register : POST --> email and pass to signup a new user
        - /login: POST --> to recieve a JWT and login an existing user

    - Please spend 30-45 mins understanding the backend implementation, but remain aware
    of the context here, which is to learn how auth work in React.

    /* 
    - We will be using the following three react hook:
        1) useState()
        2) useEffect()
        3) useContext() --> OPTIONAL for the bootsrap stuff

    - Today:
        1) Morning session is to set up the login/register pages
        2) look at the backend
        3) let you all set all this up as well. 
        4) Afternoon session: we will finish the react authentication
