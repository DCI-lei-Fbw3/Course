//Introduction

/* 
- React bootstrap was one of the first Rect third-party libraries, therefore its quite stable.
- You can use React-bootstrap the same way you would use "normal" Bootstrap, except a couple of minor details.
*/

/* 
Some other CSS frameworks:
1. Material UI
2. Sematic UI (Taimur's fav)
3. Infima (really cautious with this one)
 */

//How does RB work?

    /*  
    - Since Bootstrap relies very heavily of JQuerry, the developers working on RB had to convert
    all the jQuerry code to normal JS systax, and then fit it to React.
    - Another important note to keep in mind, RB it only takes the "normal" bootstrap code and 
    converts all that into reusable React components. However, it does not automatically provide you
    Bootstrap CSS in your code. Meaning, you still have to import Bootstrap.
    - So you need to always import the Bootstrap stylesheet, along with installing RB.
