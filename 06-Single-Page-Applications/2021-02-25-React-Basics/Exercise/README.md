## Exercise: Shop Manager

Now that we have a backend that manages our products, we want to create an application that helps us using it with a nice frontend.
We will focus on the products page first:


1. create a new repository for your frontend project and clone it to your local machine
2. run create-react-app to get you started (hint: use a dot instead of a project name to create the app in your current directory)
3. create a products page containing individual components for a navigation header, a page headline (h1), a list of products and a footer

BONUS:
4. create a Product component for one single product
5. iterate over our products to render the Product component multiple times. Please use the example collection as an array as the initial state value (remember: useState(<initialValue>))
